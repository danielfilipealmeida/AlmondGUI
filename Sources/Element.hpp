/*!
 \brief GUI Root class, from which all other GUI classes descends from

 Handles basic state and position/size. Possible events are: hover, pressed and entered. TODO (maybe) callbacks for those events. Element can also contain other elements.
 
 WORK TODO:
 
 standartize the usage of rects. they need to follow the rules:
 
 rect:
 the rect definition of the current element. it should be (0,0, totalHeigth, totalWidth);
 
 clipRect:
 the definition of printed part of the rect. If the rect is clipped (allows scrolling), this should define wich part is being displayed.
 this means that this rect cannot go outside the rect.
 Need to take into consideration if this element is inside other element.
 
 visibleRect:
 need to sort this out. suposibly this should be the final position of the rect in the screen and it is use to handle mouse hover events.
 
 Important to figure out:
 how to handle elements inside elements.
