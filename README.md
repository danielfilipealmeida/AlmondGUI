# Almond - a GUI for openFrameworks

2017 Daniel Almeida


AlmondGUI is a Graphic User Interface library built to be used with  `openFrameworks` and uses the `nanovg` library.

## Todo

-  generate gui tree for debugging (text)
- changes the sequence of drawing (gui draws only what has null parents. then each element draws it's children)
